# rememberall

We've all had the frustrating experience of knowing what to remember, but not the tools to help find that knowledge. Currently, you have to create a memo with a specific key you are searching for. Funny...you don't remember the key either. So we wanted to create a bot that can "remember" things you want to remember. You don't have to remember any keys, but simply ask RememberAll (nicely) if it has a memory of however you can describe what you want to remember.

For example, say you want to remember 'How to setup bot services'. And all you know is that the instruction had the words, "bot services", or an instruction that had the word "super cool". Any of these keywords can help you regain this memory.

So, after a long long time, if you forgot what we were called, but remember us as "That super cool bot at MSFTHacks that helps people remember things", enter it into RememberAll, and it'll tell you, "It's me!".
